## English documentation

### Setup

First install requirements (e.g. `sphinx`):

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, the HTML files can be created using:

```bash
make html
```

A live server, which auto-updates itself after a file is saved, can be started using:

```bash
make live
```

The documentation is then available on http://localhost:8001.
