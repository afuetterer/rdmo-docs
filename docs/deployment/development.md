# Development server

Django comes with an integrated development server. It can be started using:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Then, RDMO is available on `http://localhost:8000` in your (local) browser. The development server is **not** suited to serve the application to the internet.

If you want the development server to be accessible from other machines in your local network you need to use:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

where `8000` is the port and can be changed according to your needs. Please do not use this setup for more than testing and development, it is not secure. The Django development server does only serve the static files correctly if you have debug mode enabled. Therefore please do not forget to change the line `DEBUG = False` in your `config/settings/local.py` to `DEBUG = True` if you want to use it.

More information about the development server can be found in the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/#the-development-server).
