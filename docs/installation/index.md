# Installation

For demonstration, development or testing purposes, RDMO can be installed on Linux, Windows and macOS. If you, however, to set up a production environment, serving RDMO over a Network or the Internet, we suggest that you use a recent Linux distribution. We suggest to use Debian or Ubuntu LTS.

The code is mainly written in Python and works with a version higher than **Python 3.8**.

An installation of RDMO contains of three parts:

1) A directory which holds all the settings and customisations, custom to your installation of RDMO. We call this directory `rdmo-app`, but you can use any name you see fit.
2) The actual `rdmo` package, which is centrally maintained by the RDMO team, is installed as a dependency in a virtual environement.
3) A database to store the content, which is generated by the users of your RDMO installation. Currently, we support Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite.

This chapter shows how these components are set up. Optional components can be installed afterwards and are covered under [Configuration](../configuration/index.html). A development setup, suited to work on the code or on plugins, is documented under [Development](../development/index.html) .

For testing and development, you can run RDMO using your regular user account. On a production system, a dedicated user account should be used. We suggest to create a user called `rdmo` with the group `rdmo` and the home directory `/srv/rdmo`: `sudo adduser rdmo --home /srv/rdmo` . We will use this user throughout this documentation.

Do not use the `root` user to run RDMO! It is a bad idea anyway and several steps of the installation will not work. `sudo` is used in the installation when needing root-privileges to install packages.
