# User role concept in projects

You can invite other members to your projects. You have to assign them a `role` with certain permissions to make changes.
At the moment there the following roles:

* **Owner**: If you create a new project, you are automatically its owner. However, you can assign other members to be owners as well. Owners have all permissions including deleting a project.
* **Manager**: is not allowed to delete a project, but he has all other permissions including making snapshots and make changes.
* **Author**: has read and write permissions.
* **Guest**: has only read permission.
