# Upgrade

The `rdmo` package can be conveniently upgraded using the `pip` command. However, before you perform any changes to your installation, please backup the important components to a save location.

A PostgreSQL or MySQL database can be database can be dumped into a file using:

```bash
pg_dump [DBNAME] > rdmo.sql  # PostgreSQL
mysqldump -uroot -p [DBNAME] > rdmo.sql
```

Your `rdmo-app` directory (including any sqlite3 database) can be copied using the usual commands. Note that your virtual environment will not work after being moved to a different path.

In order to upgrade your RDMO installation go to your `rdmo-app` directory, activate your virtual environment, and upgrade the `rdmo` package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade rdmo
```

In order to install a specific version (e.g. 0.9.0) of RDMO use:

```bash
pip install --upgrade rdmo==0.9.0
```

After the upgrade a database migration might be necessary:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Sometimes, the static vendor files need to be downloaded again:

```bash
python manage.py download_vendor_files
```

In any case you have to deploy the changes:

```
python manage.py deploy
```

The last three commands can be combined using:

```
python manage.py upgrade
```

Please check the release notes if this, or other, steps are necessary.

## Upgrade to version 0.9.0

With version 0.9.0 we introduced the split into the `rdmo-app` and the centrally maintained `rdmo` package. Therefore a few additional steps are needed to upgrade any earlier version to 0.9.0 or beyond:

1.  In any case perform a backup of your `rdmo` directory and your database as described above.

1.  Perform the steps described in [clone](../installation/clone.html) and [packages](../installation/packages.html) as if you would install a new instance of RDMO.

1.  Copy your old configuration from `/path/to/old/rdmo/rdmo/settings/local.py` to `/path/to/new/rdmo-app/config/settings/local.py`. The new `config` directory replaces the old `rdmo` directory.

1.  If you already have a `theme` directory, copy it into the new `rdmo-app` folder.

1.  Run a database migration (Unless you skipped several versions, the output should be `No migrations to apply.`):

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

1.  Download the front-end files from the CDN. We don't use bower and npm anymore.

    ```bash
    python manage.py download_vendor_files
    ```

1.  Update the path to the `wsgi.py` script in your Apache or nginx configuration. It is now under `/path/to/new/rdmo-app/config/wsgi.py`.

1.  Redeploy RDMO as described under deployment of [Apache](../deployment/apache.html) or [Nginx](../deployment/nginx.html).

If you have trouble with the upgrade process, don't hesitate to contact the RDMO team for support.

## Upgrade to version 0.14

With version 0.14 the Python 2 support was dropped and we switched to Django 2.2. This demands two changes to the local `rdmo-app`:

* Adjust RDMO app's `config/urls.py` to Django2 schemes. The file is much simpler and shorter now. A working example can be found at https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-app/blob/master/config/urls.py
* MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in `config/settings/local.py` needs to be renamed to `MIDDLEWARE` only
